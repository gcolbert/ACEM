This folder contains data to setup ACEM for a demo :

- UEB-init-database-fr : a database for UEB context, containing a small set of data.
- UEB-default-uploaded-content : set of illustrations matching the data for UEB-init-database-fr.

IMPORTANT : you have to create a file named "ACEM-web-jsf-servlet/src/main/resources/properties/config.properties"
with at least the entries "tmp.path" and "images.path" which should point to writable folders for your server.
